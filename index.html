			Hello! <br />
			<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>
			<p>I began as a hobbyist software developer while working other jobs until one day I decided to persue a degree towards computer science. I have several areas of interest including DirectX, Node.js, Angular, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
